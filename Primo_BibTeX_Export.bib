Industry increasingly moves towards digitally enabled ‘smart factories’ that utilise the internet of things (IoT) to realise intelligent manufacturing concepts like predictive maintenance or extensive machine to machine communication. A core technology to facilitate human integration in such a system is augmented reality (AR), which provides people with an interface to interact with the digital world of a smart factory. While AR is not ready yet for industrial deployment in some areas, it is already used in others. To provide an overview of research activities concerning AR in certain shop floor operations, a total of 96 relevant papers from 2011 to 2018 are reviewed. This paper presents the state of the art, the current challenges, and future directions of manufacturing related AR research through a systematic literature review and a citation network analysis. The results of this review indicate that the context of research concerning AR gets increasingly broader, especially by addressing challenges when implementing AR solutions.},

abstract = {In manual order picking systems, a paper list specifying the name, location, and amount of each item is often given, and this would exert mental pressure on pickers while finding target shelf bins in high-density picking environments. Augmented reality (AR) can provide a friendly alternative to improve the manual order picking performance by conveying picking information into visual instruction. Nevertheless, there is still no systematic consensus to deploy the pick-by-AR associated with actual warehouse workplaces. To establish a spatial correspondence between the visual guidance with the actual workplace, the multi-marker-based global map about the warehouse floor is established in advance. Instead of traditional single marker-based pick-by-AR methods, the warehouse floor-related map can provide an accurate and continuous navigation performance for intuitive AR guidance, allowing the picker to move freely on the warehouse floor without limiting to some certain locations. Besides, a systematic pick-by-AR solution is available by integrating the proposed method to a lightweight wearable AR device, and this easy-to-deploy pick-by-AR solution can alleviate the worker’s mental effort while doing picking action. Finally, the pick-by-AR system described in the paper is deployed in the automobile assembly line, and experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can improve the picking efficiency while reducing the picking errors compared with the current paper-based order picking.},

abstract = {Purpose
Confirmations are applied in kit preparation for mixed-model assembly to promote quality, but research that explains the impact on time efficiency has been lacking. The purpose of this paper is to determine the extent to which the type of confirmation method relates to time-efficient kit preparation when order batching is applied.
Design/methodology/approach
An industrially relevant laboratory experiment is applied, simulating kit preparation with order batching for mixed-model assembly. The time efficiency is studied as associated with four confirmation methods – barcode ring scanner, button presses, voice commands and RFID-reading wristbands – when applied as pick-from and place-to confirmation. Furthermore, the paper also considers the quality outcome.
Findings
Efficiency is promoted by methods that minimise interrupting the picker’s motions when performing pick-from confirmations and with methods that allow each hand to place components and perform place-to confirmations simultaneously – here represented by button presses and RFID-reading wristbands. Moreover, combining various methods for the tasks of pick-from or place-to confirmation can benefit efficiency.
Research limitations/implications
Pickers at an early stage of the learning curve (one shift of training) were considered.
Practical implications
The findings promote the customised applications of picking information systems in industry.
Social implications
Combining various methods for the tasks of pick-from and place-to confirmation can provide more fitting applications that better align with the picker’s preferences.
Originality/value
Combinations of various methods when applied as either pick-from or place-to confirmation, or both, are studied.},

We explored how different HWD types and UI designs affect perceived workload, usability, visual discomfort, and job performance during a simulated warehouse job involving order picking and part assembly. Sixteen gender-balanced participants completed the simulated job in all combinations of two HWD types (binocular vs. monocular) and four UIs, the latter of which manipulated information mode (text-vs. graphic-based) and information availability (always-on vs. on-demand); a baseline condition was also completed (paper pick list). Job performance, workload, and usability were more affected by UI designs than HWD type. For example, the graphic-based UI reduced job completion time and number of errors by ∼13% and ∼59%, respectively. Participants had no strong preference for either of the HWD types, suggesting that the physical HWD designs tested are suboptimal.

abstract = {In exploring 3D environments from a first-person viewpoint, the narrow field-of-view makes it difficult to search for an off-screen object, a task that becomes even harder if the user is looking through the small screen of a mobile phone. This paper presents Aroundplot, a novel focus+context interface for providing multiple location cues for off-screen objects in an immersive 3D environment. One part of this technique is a mapping method from 3D spherical coordinates to 2D orthogonal fisheye, which tackles the problems of existing 3D location cue displays such as occlusion among the cues and discordance with the human frame of reference. The other part is a dynamic magnification method that magnifies the context in the direction the view is moving to alleviate the distortion of the orthogonal fisheye and thus to support precise movement. In an evaluation, the participants could find the target object for a given location cue faster and more accurately with Aroundplot than with a top-down 2D radar. They were more accurate with Aroundplot than with a 3D arrow cluster when the number of objects was large; however, accuracy with a small number of objects and the search speed with any number of objects were not significantly different.

Today, a growing number of applications based on AR solutions are being developed for industrial purposes. Although these applications are often little more than experimental prototypes, AR technology is proving highly flexible and is showing great potential in numerous areas (e.g., maintenance, training/learning, assembly or product design) and in industrial sectors (e.g., the automotive, aircraft or manufacturing industries). It is expected that AR systems will become even more widespread in the near future.
The purpose of this review is to classify the literature on AR published from 2006 to early 2017, to identify the main areas and sectors where AR is currently deployed, describe the technological solutions adopted, as well as the main benefits achievable with this kind of technology.},

The subject is important and current due to the strong social need for the implementation of the concept of sustainable development. The aim of the article is to learn about and evaluate augmented reality and lean culture in the area of sustainable development management of enterprises. The concept of sustainable development is an approach that arouses great interest among management theoreticians, but many practitioners still do not know how to effectively realize it in changing conditions. Therefore, the paper proposes the application and the use of augmented reality and lean culture assumptions in the area of sustainable development management of enterprises. In the research, the authors emphasize that the sustainable approach to enterprise management should take into account the assessment of augmented reality (AR) and instruments of lean culture in the area of management since better understanding of the coexistence of benefits, compromises, opportunities and threats related to modern technologies allows for more efficient implementation of sustainable development management in enterprises. The paper has been divided into four parts. The first part presents the concept of sustainable development in the light of the literature research. The second part shows the essence of augmented reality as a modern information technology. The third part of the paper is devoted to the presentation of the concept of lean management in enterprises. The fourth part of the paper is the case study, in which the DHL enterprise report is related to, where the applied and utilized augmented reality and lean culture in shaping sustainable development are presented. The methods used to achieve the goal are: Literature studies, descriptive analysis and case study.

Kitting is a materials feeding principle that is increasingly common in mixed-model assembly. Currently, there is no consensus within industry regarding how picking information should best be conveyed to support kit preparation and research on the topic is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether information conveyance through augmented reality can be used to support time-efficient kit preparation, considering the two commonly applied approaches of single-kit preparation and batch preparation. The paper presents a novel application of augmented reality and tests it in a realistic laboratory experiment. As a basis for comparison, a traditional printed paper list is also tested. In the experiment, augmented reality is competitive both in terms of time-efficiency and picking accuracy, both for single kit and batch preparation, which indicates that augmented reality can constitute a viable option for conveying picking information in kit preparation. Especially for the batch preparation, where more information needs to be displayed, the augmented reality application is associated with considerably better performance than the paper list. The paper suggests that future research efforts should include studies on augmented reality applied in an actual industrial setting over a longer period.},

Ideas such as the “augmented reality manual”, showing step-by-step instructions to a user wearing a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), have been implemented, but the developed systems did not pass the barrier of demonstration prototypes. One major reason, beside remaining ergonomic and hardware limitations, consists of the large effort required for creating the content of such virtual instructions and for building models allowing accurate tracking. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Cognitive Augmented Reality, which radically revises existing approaches on AR-based assistance systems and proposes a fundamentally new paradigm exploiting prior visual observation and learning of a complete manipulative workflow. More precisely, we present in this paper a complete approach for creating augmented reality content for procedural tasks from video examples, and give then details about the presentation of such content at runtime. We show that this new approach, in spite of its very challenging aspects, is scalable, and valuable from a practicable point of view.

Over the last decades, dairy farms have adopted new technologies to improve their productivity and profit. However, there remains a gap in the literature as regards the application of augmented reality in livestock farms. Head-wearable devices may offer invaluable benefits to farmers, allowing real-time information monitoring of each animal during on-farm activities.

Methods: Through the cooperation between three-dimensional (3D) gesture interaction channel and natural language instruction channel, a natural and efficient interaction between a human and swarm robots is achieved. Results: First, A 3D lasso technology realizes a batch-picking interaction of swarm robots through oriented bounding boxes. Second, control instruction labels for swarm-oriented robots are defined. The instruction label is integrated with the 3D gesture and natural language through instruction label filling. Finally, the understanding of natural language instructions is realized through a text classifier based on the maximum entropy model. A head-mounted augmented reality display device is used as a visual feedback channel. Conclusions: The experiments on selecting robots verify the feasibility and availability of the system.},

The advantages of SAR in this application are that, multiple concepts can be represented using one physical model, concepts can be modified live during the session, and additional equipment (such as head mounted displays or handheld devices) is not required, thus eliminating any possible interference with the natural interactions between participants. Interviews with design practitioners and trials with a prototype SAR system are used to identify the key challenges faced by practitioners in their current use of design representations, and to capture the technology requirements for a SAR system for use in co-design sessions. These findings can inform the work of technology developers and researchers working on systems to support co-design sessions.},

This was a challenging task, as we had to conquer different kinds of navigation problems from very coarse to very fine granularity and accuracy. The resulting setup consists of a combined and adaptive visualization to precisely and efficiently guide the user even if the actual picking target is not always in the field of view of the HMD.},

Articles on hotel management published in the last decade and useful for OJT were collected, information on the causal relationships between them extracted, and related rules saved to a rule base. Using the same data, we detected various objects through SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), a real-time object detection system. Then we matched sets of causalities and displayed them to trainees wearing AR devices. This methodology reduces development and maintenance costs required to operate OJT programmes. Trainees are immersed in the training environment, which improves the effectiveness of the training. To show the feasibility of the proposed method, we developed a prototype AR-OJT system for hotel management training, automatically extracting knowledge on hotel management from articles according to the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the AR-OJT group shows better performance in terms of learning motivation and self-regulated learning than the control OJT group. No significant difference in learning performance was found between the two groups, which implies that traditional OJT can be substituted with AR-OJT.},

abstract = {Due to rapid technical advancements and the increasing diffusion of information and communications technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) has left its fledgling stages and is now on the verge of a breakthrough. Especially in industrial applications, AR holds great potentials for performance improvements: By enriching real world environments with context-specific virtual information, manual operations can be carried out more efficiently, costly mistakes can be avoided and the mental effort for transferring information from an abstract representation (e.g. monitor) to the physical world can be significantly reduced. However, a lack of transparency regarding the equally numerous and manifold applications and benefits makes it difficult for companies to weigh the impact of AR for their business. Existing classification approaches in scientific literature mainly focus on technical aspects of AR, neglecting information essential for the strategic planning of AR. The current paper aims at filling this gap by providing a classification of industrial AR use cases. The basis is a classification scheme consisting of eight classification criteria, each with several predefined characteristics, specifically tailored to the industrial use of AR. In a comprehensive literature research, 75 industrial application examples for AR were determined and described using the classification scheme. By performing a cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling, the AR application examples were grouped according to their similarity, resulting in 16 clusters, each representing a generic use case for AR. Further information was researched for each use case (e.g. benefits, opportunities, risks) and summarized in a profile. Thus, the paper provides two core results: (1) A classification scheme for describing industrial AR applications, extending the state of the art with an use-case-related classification approach. (2) A catalogue with 16 AR use case profiles, providing transparency on industrial applications and potential benefits of AR and inspiring companies on how to utilize AR for their own business.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality has a wide-ranging presentation space. In addition to presenting virtual information in a 3D space, such information can also be placed in relation to physical objects, locations or events.
Decomposing this presentation space – or more exactly, the principles of how information is represented in Augmented Reality – into unique and independent dimensions provides a fundamental spectrum of options. First, this decomposition facilitates a fine-grained analysis of effects on human understanding. Second, multiple factors, given by multiple differences between different presentation systems with respect to more than one such principle, can be determined and properly addressed. Third, this decomposition facilitates a determination of new fields of research by identifying not-yet-used concepts.
Since the beginning of Augmented Reality research, a growing number of applications have emerged that exploit various ways to represent information. This paper resumes this development and presents a set of independent dimensions covering representation principles of virtual information related to a physical environment: the temporality of virtual information, dimensionality, the frame of reference, mounting/registration and the type of reference. The suitability of the devised dimensions is tested by categorizing a wide variety of AR applications. The categorized data is analyzed for the most-often and less-frequently used combinations of classes. In particular, the classes that have not yet been used exhibit the potential to allow future work that investigates new options for information presentation.

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate how modern network video technology could be used to improve different warehouse types and operations and how barriers may prevent its implementation.
Design/methodology/approach
An exploratory multiple-case study with nine case companies was conducted, including on-site visits, interviews, questionnaires and a workshop.
Findings
The authors identified 12 video applications that could improve warehouse operations by making them safer, faster, more transparent and more reliable than they are at present. The authors found that video applications complemented existing information technology and offered a new dimension that provided the real-time analysis of different activities in warehouse operations. The main barriers to implementing video technology included uncertain return on investment, staff integrity, union restrictions and integration with other systems.
Research limitations/implications
The study contributes to the literature by exploring how information technology could be used to improve warehouse operations and by developing a classification matrix that outlines the video applications that suit the warehouse type and operation. Building on the contingency theory, the authors also described a conceptual framework for guiding future relevant research on warehousing.
Practical implications
Video technology provides an opportunity to improve efficiency and cut costs in warehouse operations, which could contribute to increasing the competitiveness of the company and the supply chain. However, several barriers must be overcome to enable its implementation. Furthermore, competing technologies, such as augmented reality and the internet of things, are being developed in parallel.
Social implications
The identified video applications could help to increase safety, sustainability and traceability in warehouse operations and, potentially, across the entire supply chain.
Originality/value
This research is the first to explore the potential of introducing video applications to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of various warehouse types and operations.},

There has been a rapid increase in research evaluating usability of Augmented Reality (AR) systems in recent years. Although many different styles of evaluation are used, there is no clear consensus on the most relevant approaches. We report a review of papers published in International Symposium of Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) proceedings in the past decade, building on the previous work of Swan and Gabbard (2005). Firstly, we investigate the evaluation goal, measurement and method of ISMAR papers according to their usability research in four categories: performance, perception and cognition, collaboration and User Experience (UX). Secondly, we consider the balance of evaluation approaches with regard to empirical–analytical, quantitative–qualitative and participant demographics. Finally we identify potential emphases for usability study of AR systems in the future. These analyses provide a reference point for current evaluation techniques, trends and challenges, which benefit researchers intending to design, conduct and interpret usability evaluations for future AR systems.},

While several research publications exist on applications of XR in manufacturing training, a comprehensive review of recent works and applications is lacking to present a clear progress in using such advance technologies. To this end, we present a review of the current state-of-the-art of use of XR technologies in training personnel in the field of manufacturing. First, we put forth the need of XR in manufacturing. We then present several key application domains where XR is being currently applied, notably in maintenance training and in performing assembly task. We also reviewed the applications of XR in other vocational domains and how they can be leveraged in the manufacturing industry. We finally present some current barriers to XR adoption in manufacturing training and highlight the current limitations that should be considered when looking to develop and apply practical applications of XR.},

abstract = {•A new study that forecasts the daily arrival pattern of e-commerce orders.•An AR-ANFIS model for e-order arrival prediction is proposed.•A two-stage model performance validation is introduced.•Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms ARIMA model.
The complexity of today's e-commerce logistics environment compels practitioners to achieve a higher level of operating efficiency. As it is infeasible for operators to process a large number of discrete e-orders individually, warehouse postponement, that is, delaying the execution of a logistics process until the last possible moment, is essential. Yet the question remains as to how one can accurately identify the timing for consolidating e-orders, and subsequently releasing the grouped e-orders for batch order picking. This is a subject, lacking previous research, but is fundamentally crucial in today's e-commerce logistics environment. This paper introduces an integrated autoregressive-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (AR-ANFIS) approach for forecasting e-commerce order arrivals. Two AR-ANFIS models are built for evaluating their prediction ability against ARIMA models. The experimental results confirm the suitability of the hybrid model for forecasting e-order arrivals. To make use of the model output, an algorithm is formulated to convert e-order arrival figures into cut-off time of order grouping. In this sense, this total solution, packaged as a decision support system, namely the E-order arrival prediction system, assists logistics practitioners in judging when to release the grouped e-orders for batch processing, and essentially improves their order handling capability.},

The aim of the current study was to develop a reading concentration monitoring system for use with e-books in an intelligent classroom and to help instructors find out the students' reading concentration rates. The proposed system uses three types of sensor technologies, namely a webcam, heartbeat sensor, and blood oxygen sensor to detect the learning behaviors of students by capturing various physiological signals. An artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization approach is applied to the data gathered from these sensors to help instructors understand their students' reading concentration rates in a classroom learning environment. The results show that the use of the ABC algorithm in the proposed system can effectively obtain near-optimal solutions. The system has a user-friendly graphical interface, making it easy for instructors to clearly understand the reading status of their students.},

abstract = {•A rigorous model for the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking is presented.•It selects the vehicle routing dock assignment and truck scheduling all at once.•It handles fleet of vehicles with different capacities and costs.•To improve the computational efficiency, sweep-heuristic based-models are developed.•A large number of heterogeneous VRPCD examples are successfully solved.
Cross-docking is a logistics technique applied by many industrial firms to get substantial savings in two warehousing costly functions like storage and order picking. Incoming shipments are unloaded from inbound trucks on a cross-dock terminal with minimal storage space and directly transferred to outbound vehicles that carry them to their destinations. The major decisions at the operational level are the vehicle routing and scheduling, the dock door assignment and the truck scheduling at the cross-dock. Because such decisions are interdependent, all of them are simultaneously considered in the so-called vehicle routing problem with cross-docking (VRPCD). Previous contributions on VRPCD assume that pickup and delivery tasks are accomplished by a homogeneous vehicle fleet, and they mostly ignore the internal transportation of goods through the cross-dock. This work introduces a new rigorous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the VRPCD problem to determine the routing and scheduling of a mixed vehicle fleet, the dock door assignment, the truck docking sequence and the travel time required to move the goods to the assigned stack door all at once. To improve the computational efficiency of the branch-and-cut search, an approximate sweep-based model is developed by also considering a set of constraints mimicking the sweep algorithm for allocating nodes to vehicles. Numerous heterogeneous VRPCD examples involving up to 50 transportation requests and a heterogeneous fleet of 10 vehicles with three different capacities were successfully solved using the proposed approaches in acceptable CPU times.},

Therefore, to establish the right technology for every specific business context is a decision that need to be evaluated in a right way. The purpose of this paper is to create an intelligent decision model to select the most appropriate order picking technology. The present study shows an artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the results of an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weighting of the determining criteria and the prioritization of the different technologies from several experts are obtained through the AHP, while the artificial neural network is used to automate the decision process. The designed ANN can synthesize expert judgments and then predict the prioritization of order picking technologies.},

abstract = {In the traditional order completion time (OCT) prediction methods, some mutable and ideal production data (e.g., the arrival time of work in process (WIP), the planned processing time of all operations, and the expected waiting time per operation) are often used. Thus, the prediction time always deviates from the actual completion time dramatically even though the dynamicity of the production capacity and the real-time load conditions of job shop are considered in the OCT prediction method. On account of this, a new prediction method of OCT using the composition of order and real-time job shop RFID data is proposed in this article. It applies accurate RFID data to depict the real-time load conditions of job shop, and attempts to mine the mapping relationship between RFID data and OCT from historical data. Firstly, RFID devices capture the types and waiting list information of all WIPs which are in the in-stocks and out-stocks of machining workstations, and the real-time processing progress of all WIPs which are under machining at machining workstations. Secondly, a description model of real-time job shop load conditions is put forward by using the RFID data. Next, the mapping model based on the composition of order and real-time RFID data is established. Finally, deep belief network, which is one of the major technologies of deep neural networks, is applied to mine the mapping relationship. To illustrate the advantages of the proposed method, a numerical experiment compared with back-propagation (BP) network based prediction method, multi-hidden-layers BP network based prediction method and the principal components analysis and BP network based prediction method is conducted at last.},

•Emissions tax cost, penalty cost; discount and limitation on total emissions are considered.•Dynamic sequencing for sequencing S/R requests is studied.•Adding loading/unloading time and energy consumption by robot, conveyor and S/R machine.•The results showed that GA in terms of total cost, performance cost and GHG cost has better performance over ACO.
In some AS/RS, the S/R machine executes a storage request and then a retrieval request to form a dual command (DC) cycle. This paper deals with a DC cycle “dynamic sequencing” method in unit-load multiple-rack AS/RS system. To create a kind of greenhouse gas (GHG) efficiency in the model, tax cost, penalty cost and discount of produced GHG emissions, limitations on available time of all facilities and total permitted GHG emissions produced by all equipment are considered in the model. In addition, an ant colony optimization (ACO) is employed to find a near-optimum solution of proposed mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the GHG efficiency in AS/RS. Since no benchmark is available in the literature, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed as well to validate the result obtained. For further validation, warehouse throughput rate in terms of time and cost is calculated for the model. At the end, twenty numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. Our results verified that GA was able to find better and nearer optimal solutions.},

The analytical approach is the socio-technical system, which assumes that new technologies will also result in personnel and organizational changes. These considerations form a framework, which amalgates the perspectives of human actors, technology and organization and ultimately leads to a complementary design of industrial labor.},

abstract = {In order to differentiate from competitors in terms of customer service, warehouses accept late orders while providing delivery in a quick and timely way. This trend leads to a reduced time to pick an order. This paper introduces workload forecasting in a warehouse context, in particular a zone picking warehouse. Improved workforce planning can contribute to an effective and efficient order picking process. Most order picking publications treat demand as known in advance. As warehouses accept late orders, the assumption of a constant given demand is questioned in this paper. The objective of this study is to present time series forecasting models that perform well in a zone picking warehouse. A real-life case study demonstrates the value of applying time series forecasting models to forecast the daily number of order lines. The forecast of order lines, along with order pickers' productivity, can be used by warehouse supervisors to determine the daily required number of order pickers, as well as the allocation of order pickers across warehouse zones. Time series are applied on an aggregated level, as well as on a disaggregated zone level. Both bottom-up and top-down approaches are evaluated in order to find the best-performing forecasting method.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) encompasses a plethora of digital technologies effecting on manufacturing enterprises. Most research on this topic examines the effects in the smart factory domain, focusing on production scheduling. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in manufacturing life-cycle processes. This paper is thus intended to provide a systematic literature review answering the following research question: What are the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in the business processes of manufacturing companies? The study analyses 186 articles and the results show that production scheduling and control is the process most often investigated, while there is also an increasing trend in servitization and circular supply chain management. Moreover, there is extensive combined use of IoT, Big Data Analytics and Cloud, whose applications cover a wide range of processes. On the contrary, other technology like Blockchain is not as widely discussed in the domain of I4.0. This picture calls for a future research agenda extending the scope of investigation into I4.0 in manufacturing. Furthermore, the results of this research can prove extremely useful for practitioners who wish to implement one or more technologies, providing them with solutions for applications in manufacturing.},

abstract = {Order picking (OP) is one of the most labour- and time-intensive processes in internal logistics. Over the last decades, researchers have developed various mathematical planning models that help to increase the efficiency of OP systems, for example, by optimising storage assignments or by specifying routes for the order pickers that minimise travel distance in the warehouse. Human characteristics that are often a major determinant of OP system performance have, however, widely been ignored in this stream of research. This paper systematically evaluates the literature on manual OP systems and conducts a content analysis to gain insights into how human factors (HF) have been considered and discussed in the scientific literature. The results of the analysis indicate that management-oriented efficiency criteria dominated prior research on OP, and that there is a clear lack of attention to HF in the design and management of OP systems. This poses an opportunity for research and design of manual OP systems.},

The Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) in its canonical form and its various versions are used to solve different types of problems and are reported to perform better compared with other heuristics (i.e., genetic algorithms, neural networks, etc.) in some cases, such as function optimization and pattern recognition. Although the studies related with CSA are increasingly popular, according to our best knowledge, there is no study summarizing the basic features of these algorithms, hybrid algorithms, and the application areas of these algorithms all in one paper. Therefore, this study aims to summarize the powerful characteristics and general review of CSA. In addition, CSA based hybrid algorithms are reviewed, and open research areas are discussed for further research.},
